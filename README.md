### Stack
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (feel free to list any frameworks you guys want to use)
- Firebase (let me know if there are any hosting you guys prefer, I use this one though coz they provide DB (json), user management, authentication. its easy, i didnt have to setup my own backend server. Using Firebase made me focus more on Front-End)
