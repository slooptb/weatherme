### Description
an app generating activities base on weather condition.

### Goal/User Stories
to build an app that 
- detects **current location**
- uses simpleweather api to get **weather condition** of **current location**
- **generate activities** we can do base off of **weather condition**

### APIs we'll use
- SimpleWeather API
- Trip Advisor

### Stack
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (feel free to list any frameworks you guys want to use)
- Firebase (let me know if there are any hosting you guys prefer, I use this one though coz they provide DB (json), user management, authentication. its easy, i didnt have to setup my own backend server. Using Firebase made me focus more on Front-End)

@slooptb has you mention, 
*Seems like you could have a flat file JSON with lists of activities and weather suitability then build the map based on what's returned from simpleweather API.... actually sounds fairly easy (he says before trying it....)
Then future builds could incorporate a DB and admin GUI or something*

we can probably use Firebase to get it up and running and transfer when incorporate DB, admin GUI, etc
